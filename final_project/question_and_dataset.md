September 30 (Mandatory): Question and Data Set

What is the question you hope to answer? What data are you planning to use to answer that question? What do you know about the data so far? Why did you choose this topic?

I'm planning to predict the number of likes your Instagram post will receive based on the number of previous likes your posts have gotten, video v picture, public v private, hashtags, number of followers, time of day posted, etc. 

I know that the Instagram API has a lot of data but I also know that the data can have a lot of 'noise.'

I chose this topic because one of my friends was talking about waiting to post her picture because she knows it will get more likes at a certain point and it made me wonder whether I could create an algorithm to predict the same thing (but based on my factors).
